## Project Overview
Project Deimos was a huge leap in technical capacity for the ARES Rocket Team.  It was the team's first ever supersonic rocket, first ever to enter the 30,000ft category at the Spaceport America Cup, and first to include CNC components and custom avionics.  As the "Chief Engineer" of the team I was essentially responsible for the mechanical design of the rocket, as well as being heavily involved in the composite and metal manufacturing processes. 

## Composite Manufacturing
Deimos was a proving ground for early composites development, with our first forays into carbon fibre, with 'tip-to-tip' reinforced fins, alongside a complex compound-curve fibreglass transition and nosecone.  Mold plugs were turned down on a wood lathe using a profile template, and outer molds 3d printed.

## CNC Manufacturing
First ARES project to utilise CNC manufacturing for internal bulkheads, custom CO2 ejection system and nosetip.

## Test Flight Campaign
A largely successful flight to approximately half the competition altitude, flying on a smaller motor to comply with our Australian waiver ceiling.

## Competition

Around one second into flight, Deimos experienced aerodynamic instability kick-started by a motor anomaly and amplified by fins designed to operate at their aeroelastic limit, at the best of times.  In the blink of an eye, the rocket was in a million pieces, and the remaining days of competition were spent scouring the desert for the evidential remains.  Long story short, commercial rocket motors are unforgiving beasts, and our design, in all it's mass-optimised glory, had clearly flown too close to the sun.

A lot of the lessons learned in this fast and furious program were extremely valuable to our young team of the time.  Taking over as Team Lead for the following cycle, these (painful) lessons ended up driving us to a successful program and flight at competition the following year, with Project Florence.
