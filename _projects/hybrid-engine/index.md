## Project background
After the success of Florence at Spaceport America in 2024, it was decided that the next step for the rocket team would be to develop a hybrid rocket engine. As Propulsion Lead for the 2024-25 cycle, I have led the development of a robust GSE (fluids+DAQ) system, engine test stand, design and optimisation software suite, as well as a subscale engine (this project).

- Engine sizing and simulation
- Mechanical design
- Thermal simulation
- Structural simulation
